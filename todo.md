**Development Server**: http://localhost:3000
**All fixes tested and validated**

---

## ‚ùå **Error Fix 1: Quick Preview Removal** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Issue Identified
- **Problem**: Quick preview feature was causing data inconsistencies and poor user experience

- **Database Query Fix**: Changed `select('code, school_name')` to `select('code, name')`
- **Response Mapping Fix**: Updated `school.school_name` to `school.name` in response transformation
- **Validation**: Verified field name matches existing school profile API usage

### Technical Changes
```typescript
// FIXED in /api/schools/route.ts:
// Before (BROKEN):
.select('code, school_name')
name: school.school_name

// After (WORKING):
.select('code, name')
name: school.name
```

### Verification
- **Console Logs**: Changed from `GET /api/schools 500` to `GET /api/schools 200`
